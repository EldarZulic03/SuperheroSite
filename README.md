# SuperheroSite 
SuperheroSite was built using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB


### Some of SuperheroSite's cool features:
- Create an account, then verify it through email
- Unauthenticated users can search for their favourite superheroes and view authenticated users' lists
- Authenticated users can search for their favourite superheroes and put them into lists for others to see, they can also edit and delete these lists as well as change the visibility so either only they can see it or all their friends can see it!!!!
- Search results can be expanded to show stats like superpowers, publisher, race, height not just the superhero name
- Admins can log in and delete accounts
